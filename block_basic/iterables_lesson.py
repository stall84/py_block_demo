# 3 types of iterables in Python

# List (Array)
iterable = [
    "milk",
    "honey",
    "milk",
]  # mutable, ordered (order guaranteed), duplicates allowed

set_list = {
    "milk",
    "honey",
}  # mutable, un-ordered (order not guaranteed). Written with curly brackets. NO duplicates allowed

ma_tuple = ("Milk", "Honey")  # Imutable, ordered, duplicates OK,
